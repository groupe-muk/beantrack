# Orders Card Component - Updated Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Status Values
- **Rejected**: Used when admin/supplier rejects incoming orders
- **Cancelled**: Used when user cancels their own orders

### 2. Added Order Type Logic
- **order_type: 'received'**: Orders received by the user (show Accept/Reject buttons)
- **order_type: 'made'**: Orders made by the user (show Cancel button)

### 3. Updated Dashboard Controller Logic

#### Admin Dashboard
- Shows orders from **vendors (wholesalers)** for **coffee products**
- Orders are marked as `'order_type' => 'received'`
- Admin can Accept or Reject these orders

#### Supplier Dashboard  
- Shows orders from **admin (factory)** for **raw coffee**
- Orders are marked as `'order_type' => 'received'`
- Supplier can Accept or Reject these orders

#### Vendor Dashboard
- Shows orders **made by vendor** to **admin (factory)** for **coffee products**
- Orders are marked as `'order_type' => 'made'`
- Vendor can Cancel their own orders
- Removed placeholder "No orders yet" entry

### 4. Updated Order Controller
- Added 'rejected' and 'cancelled' to valid status values
- Both statuses are now properly handled

### 5. Enhanced UI
- **Received Orders**: Green "Accept Order" + Gray "Reject" buttons
- **Made Orders**: Red "Cancel Order" button
- **Non-pending Orders**: Status badge + "View Details" link
- Added proper loading states and confirmations

## Order Flow Summary

```
Admin (Factory):
- RECEIVES orders from Vendors for Coffee Products → Can Accept/Reject
- MAKES orders to Suppliers for Raw Coffee → Can Cancel

Supplier:
- RECEIVES orders from Admin for Raw Coffee → Can Accept/Reject

Vendor (Wholesaler):
- MAKES orders to Admin for Coffee Products → Can Cancel
```

## Database Order Types

Based on the orders table structure:
- `supplier_id` + `raw_coffee_id` = Admin ordering from Supplier
- `wholesaler_id` + `coffee_product_id` = Vendor ordering from Admin

## Status Flow

1. **pending** → Initial state
2. **confirmed** → Order accepted
3. **rejected** → Order declined by recipient
4. **cancelled** → Order cancelled by creator
5. **shipped** → Order dispatched  
6. **delivered** → Order completed

## Testing Status

The implementation now correctly:
- Shows appropriate buttons based on order direction
- Updates status to 'rejected' when orders are declined
- Updates status to 'cancelled' when orders are cancelled
- Handles empty states gracefully
- Provides proper user feedback
