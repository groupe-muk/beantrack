# Real-Time Chat Debugging Guide

## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

### 🚨 Duplicate Messages Issue
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Messages appearing twice in chat
**Root Cause**: Multiple real-time connections (Echo + Pusher) both active
**Solution Applied**: Disabled Pusher fallback, use Echo exclusively

**If you encounter this again**:
1. Check console logs for both Echo and Pusher messages
2. Verify Pusher fallback is disabled in `enablePusherFallback()`
3. Ensure only one connection method is active

### 🚨 JavaScript Changes Not Applying  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Code changes don't appear in browser
**Root Cause**: File not included in Vite build process
**Solution Applied**: Added `chat.js` to Vite config, use `@vite()` directive

**Prevention**:
```javascript
// vite.config.js - Always include chat files
input: [
    'resources/css/app.css', 
    'resources/js/app.js',
    'resources/js/chat.js'  // Critical!
],
```

```blade
{{-- Blade template - Use compiled version --}}
@vite('resources/js/chat.js')
```

## Debug Console Commands

### Enable Debug Mode
```javascript
// In browser console
ChatUtils.enableDebug()
// Refresh page to see detailed logs
```

### Check Connection Status
```javascript
ChatUtils.checkConnection()
// Shows Pusher connection state and channels
```

### Disable Debug Mode
```javascript
ChatUtils.disableDebug()
```

## Console Log Patterns

### ✅ Healthy System Logs
```
🚀 Chat system initializing...
📋 Chat initialization data: {currentUserId: 'U00012', receiverId: 'U00013', csrfToken: 'present'}
🔌 Setting up real-time connection...
📡 Attempting Laravel Echo connection...
✅ Laravel Echo setup complete
📡 Pusher fallback available but disabled to prevent duplicates
✅ Chat system initialized successfully
```

### ⚠️ Warning Signs
```
📡 Setting up direct Pusher connection...  // Should NOT appear
✅ Direct Pusher binding established       // Should NOT appear  
📨 Direct Pusher message.sent received    // Should NOT appear
```

### 🔄 Duplicate Detection (Safety Net)
```
📥 Processing incoming message: {messageId: '685bb076bc2a8', ...}
🔄 Duplicate message detected, skipping: 685bb076bc2a8
```

## Asset Management Debugging

### Check Build Output
```bash
npm run build
# Look for: public/build/assets/chat-[hash].js
```

### Verify Vite Manifest
```bash
# Check if chat.js is included
cat public/build/manifest.json | grep chat
```

### Browser Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools → Network
2. Refresh page
3. Look for `chat-[hash].js` being loaded
4. Verify it's not loading from `resources/js/chat.js` directly

## Real-Time Connection Debugging

### Pusher Dashboard
1. Visit [Pusher Dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/)
2. Go to your app → Debug Console
3. Send a test message
4. Verify events are being triggered

### Laravel Logs
```bash
# Check for broadcasting errors
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i broadcast
```

### Echo Connection Test
```javascript
// In browser console
window.Echo.connector.pusher.connection.state
// Should return 'connected'
```

## Common Error Patterns

### Import/Compilation Errors
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: ChatUtils is not defined
// Solution: Ensure chat.js is compiled via Vite
```

### Connection Errors
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://ws-...' failed
// Solution: Check Pusher credentials
```

### Route Errors
```
HTTP 500 on /chat/receive
// Solution: Check Laravel logs, verify Request import
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Full Reset
1. Clear browser cache
2. Rebuild assets: `npm run build`
3. Restart Laravel server
4. Test with fresh browser session

### Emergency Fallback
If Echo fails completely, Pusher fallback can be re-enabled:
1. Uncomment binding code in `enablePusherFallback()`
2. Uncomment timer-based activation
3. Monitor for duplicate messages

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Monitor console for error patterns
- Verify real-time messages deliver instantly
- Check Laravel logs for broadcasting errors

### After Code Changes
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Test chat functionality
3. Verify console logs show expected patterns
4. Clear browser cache if issues persist

### Performance Monitoring
- Watch for large asset bundle warnings
- Monitor database query performance
- Check for memory leaks in JavaScript

## Contact and Escalation

For persistent issues:
1. Gather console logs (with debug mode enabled)
2. Check Laravel logs for errors
3. Document steps to reproduce
4. Note which connection method was active
5. Include browser and environment details
